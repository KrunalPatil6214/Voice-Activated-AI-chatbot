# Voice-Activated AI Chatbot

A voice-activated AI chatbot using Python, capable of responding to a range of
commands, conducting online searches, fetching information from Wikipedia, interacting with system commands, and more. This project demonstrates the integration of voice recognition, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and simple automation using Python.

## Features

*   **Voice Input**: Utilizes the microphone to capture user speech.
*   **Speech-to-Text**: Converts spoken language into text for processing.
*   **AI Integration**: Leverages an AI model to generate intelligent and contextual responses.
*   **Text-to-Speech**: Articulates the AI's text response back to the user.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.9+
*   An active internet connection for AI model access.
*   A microphone connected to your system.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/KrunalPatil6214/Voice-Activated-AI-chatbot.git
    cd Voice-Activated-AI-chatbot
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```sh
    # For Windows
    python -m venv .venv
    .\.venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install the required packages:**
    *(You should create a `requirements.txt` file for this step)*
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **API Keys:**
    If the project uses external APIs (like OpenAI, Google AI, etc.), create a `.env` file and add your API keys:
    ```
    API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
    ```

## Usage

Run the main application script from your terminal:

```sh
python main.py
```

Wait for the "Listening..." prompt, then speak your command or question into the microphone.

## Technologies Used

*   **Python**: Core programming language.
*   **SpeechRecognition**: For converting speech to text.
*   **pyttsx3** / **gTTS**: For text-to-speech conversion.
*   **[AI Model/Library]**: The AI library used for generating responses (e.g., OpenAI, Gemini, etc.).
